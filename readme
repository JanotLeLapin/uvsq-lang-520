UVSQ yacc/flex project

prerequisites: Nix

I happen to be running NixOS (an immutable operating system) where
libraries aren't located in a convenient /lib or /usr/lib, so
shipping a typical Makefile would be annoying expecially for
the linker. Nix derivations solve the same problem as Makefiles,
but in a more predictable, reproducible and portable way.

usage:
- nix build .#regexp-compiler
- ./result/bin/regexp-compiler < input_file
